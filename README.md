# Scalable-Task-Scheduler-
Designed a priority-based task scheduling system supporting dynamic task insertion, deletion, and execution. Implemented min-heap / priority queue for efficient task retrieval with O(log n) time complexity. Used hash maps for constant-time task lookup, updates, and cancellation.
